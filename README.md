OpenWeatherMap API

✅ Data Source: OpenWeatherMap
Your app uses the OpenWeatherMap API, which is a widely used public weather service. Its data comes from:
Ground stations
Weather radars
Satelltes
Commercial data partners

So yes, it's fairly accurate for general public use, especially for large or medium-sized cities.

🧐 But Accuracy Depends On:
Factor	Impact
🌍 City or Region Size	Big cities have better data coverage; small towns may have estimates.
🕒 Update Frequency	OpenWeatherMap updates hourly, but there may be slight delays.
📡 Weather Type	Temperature and humidity are usually accurate; rain/cloud conditions can be off by a little.
🛰 Free vs Paid API	Free tier uses slightly less accurate endpoints than professional/paid ones.

✅ For Most Users:

Temperatures: ±1–2°C accuracy

Humidity/Wind: Good estimates

Forecasts (if added): Good for 1–2 days ahead, less reliable beyond that
